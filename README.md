# Social Network API

## User Story
For this challenge I was appointed to create an API for a social network app so that users may create a User, share their thoughts, create reactions & have the ability to see the number of friends/reactions.

## Technologies
In this application I used Mongoose, Express, MongoDB & the imsomnia application for testing & use.

## Challenges
I faced numerous challenges when creating this application as their are many details that go into creating something dynamic as this. Although it became difficult at times I definitely felt myself become more comfortable with the implication of all the necessities to create something dynamic as this. I hope to keep working on my knowledge and practicing to become better at building prestigious applications.
